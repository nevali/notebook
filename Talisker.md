# Talisker

https://github.com/TaliskerPlatform

Scalable, portable, lightweight operating system.

"Personalities" provide high-level support for operating environments, utilising virtualisation where available.

Lowest-level components are _native_ (i.e., interface directly with the kernel, without the aid of an existing runtime); various supported kernels (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, XNU).

Higher-level components provide a language-agnostic OOP interface (via COM interfaces) 

Aspects inspired by NeXTSTEP, Taligent, Workplace OS, NTOS, BeOS
