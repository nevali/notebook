# Grid

Distributed knowledge database

* Federated search across *public* [DAT](https://datproject.org)-serving nodes
* Built as an extension to the protocol, so it works transparently across the swarm
* Distance/confidence metrics
* Stores and retrieves factoids: assertions about things
* Built on [RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/)
