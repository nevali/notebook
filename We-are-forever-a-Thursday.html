<h1>We-are-forever-a-Thursday</h1>
<p>Thursday</p>
<p>it's not the weekend but we can pretend it is</p>
<p>at 2am in a dingy bar in the city centre does it matter anyway?</p>
<p>“you working tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“aye”</p>
<p>always comes with a sigh</p>
<p>the sound of being reminded of the reality we're here to avoid</p>
<p>9 o’clock, lunchtime, 6-’til-close.</p>
<p>she's off. you can tell.</p>
<p>she's got that &quot;I don't have to work on Friday&quot; look about her.</p>
<p>smug<br>as<br>fuck</p>
<p>that's not Thursday.<br>that's just Friday come early.<br>doesn't count.</p>
<p>Thursday</p>
<p>always seems like a better idea than it ever is</p>
<p>but you wouldn't trade it, would you?</p>
<p>aye, it's busy,</p>
<p>but it's not weekend busy.</p>
<p>the misfits are out.</p>
<p>the students, the artists,<br>the ones that got away.</p>
<p>&quot;my round, what you having?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;same again, but I'm going after this&quot;</p>
<p>you know she won't.</p>
<p>Thursday</p>
<p>the acceptable face of irresponsibility</p>
<p>don't fuck it tho, aye?</p>
<p>nobody wants to watch a Thursday become a Friday</p>
<p>at 1, 2, 3am, we feel invincible</p>
<p>we are forever<br>a Thursday.</p>
