<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_system">conversational agent</a> built on <a href="Ceiba.md">Ceiba</a> and <a href="Grid.md">Grid</a></li>
<li>Nodes owned by the same (Ceiba) identity can communicate with one another and share resources (e.g., ask Metas to launch an application on your laptop from your phone, opening a document can transport it if needed)</li>
<li>Grid searches are filtered/scaled by the social graph as a reliability metric (+ configurable trusted sources)</li>
<li>Skills are plug-ins that can provide new capabilities. Skills are installed automatically, and are silent if not available due to missing underlying capabilities (e.g., a skill to allow discovery of devices via Bluetooth would be auto-disabled if no Bluetooth interface was available)</li>
<li>Native app (mobile, desktop) providing a &quot;conversational command-line&quot; and speech interfaces + background agent</li>
<li>Decisions are stored anonymously and non-identifiably in the Grid
<ul>
<li>A decision is a question or query, accompanied by a set of options, a recommendation based upon available facts, and an optional outcome (which option was chosen)</li>
<li>Decision records are used by Metas instances to bias their own recommendations based upon past behaviours (with emphasis on those with closer social connections)</li>
</ul></li>

<pre><code>Hello, my name is Metas. If you would like, I can speak out loud to you as well.

Would you like me to speak? I can be quiet whenever you need me to be.

Just say or type &#39;yes&#39; or no&#39;, or words to that effect.

&gt; yes

Would you like to choose what kind of voice I have?

70% of people seem to prefer the British female voice. 

If you would like me to use the British female voice, just say &#39;that&#39;s fine&#39;. If you&#39;d rather choose, just say &#39;a different one&#39;.

&gt; that&#39;s great, thanks

Hi. How does that sound?

If you can&#39;t hear anything, check your volume controls and say &#39;try again&#39;. Otherwise, just tell me that it sounds fine.

&gt; sounds good

I&#39;m pleased to hear that.

Have you used Metas before, or would you like a guided tour of what I can do?

&gt; I&#39;ve used you before

No problem. I&#39;ll be here when you need something.
