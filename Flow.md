# Flow

https://github.com/nevali/flow

* Strict superset of C (plain C code can be passed straight through)
* Additionally supports COM IDL idioms (module, interface, [co]class, etc)
* ...and IDL/C#-style attributes
* COM IDL is valid Flow (but will only produce RPC stubs on its own)
* Additional syntax provided for class implementations; both inline and out-of-line definitions will generate identical code
