# Introduction

Acropolis is a toolkit for building and maintaining knowledge graphs. The Acropolis stack powers the BBC's Research & Education Space and Datalab projects.

## Research & Education Space

RES's purpose is to construct a knowledgebase of Linked Open Data, a reasonable amount of which (thanks in part to our intervention) ought to concern or relate to creative works with associated accessible (subject to licensing/access controls) media assets which may be presented in a variety of ways, and in doing so always represent the origins of the data and ensure where possible that applications can retrieve it, both because RES won't always retain the finer (domain-specific) detail, and because RES doesn't claim to be authoritative.
